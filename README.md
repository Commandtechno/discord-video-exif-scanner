there was a vulnerability that included exif data in video (including location)

this tool scans your [discord data package](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004027692-Requesting-a-Copy-of-your-Data) for attachments that include location metadata

hopefully you dont get doxxed like me!!!

# usage

```
go run . [unzipped package path]
```
